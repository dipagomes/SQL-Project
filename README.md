# SQL-Project
Here I have created a named High School Enrollment System which is a database project made using SQL through MYSQL. As we know a database is an organized collection of structured information or data. So, it will be best if all the data related to enrolling process in a school is kept in a database.<br>
There are some problems which are encountered which can be removed by implementing this project. Some of those problems which affects the Managementâ€™s Students in their various needs are as follows.

1.	Inadequate information dissemination to the students and general public<br>
2.	Extensive use of paper during students Registration exercise <br>
3.	The existing types of Database is not dynamic <br>
4.	Lack of uploading facility on the website <br>
5.	Inability to reach global forum. <br>
